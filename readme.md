#Node WordGuess CLI
###Javascript constructors + modularization

A hangman-style CLI built in node. Run with `node index.js`. Requires Node, Inquirer, and ChalkPipe

##Set-up

1. Install Node dependencies: run `npm install` to install dependencies in `package.json`  
2. Run `node index.js`

##Customization 

You can customize the CLI by changing the words in `index.js`, using a scraper to scrape random words from Reddit, Wikipedia, some other API, etc. (try using my [node-scraper tool](https://github.com/Froglegg/node-scraper)).
